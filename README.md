My first personal project. This project focuses on data cleaning.
Data cleaing is an early crucial step in the data analytics process. 
This project entails the basics yet essentials of data cleaning such as removing duplicates, dealing with nulls, spliting some columns to make data more readable,organized and more useful, deleting unused and unnecessary columns, standardizing columns and rename columns.
It also involves a CTE and self join use case
